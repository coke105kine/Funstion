Assignment 3 README

Please include a README.txt file that briefly explains who did what, and anything that may not be completed yet.

During this part of our app development, we were able to get started on the “front page” of our app. Jiajie created the login screen, register screen, and main screen. The login screen also has a link to the register screen in case the user does not have an account. For now they are just textfields and links. The data storage capabilities have not been implemented yet. Anthony and Jason each created a question screen. The question is a textview and the answer options are buttons. From here on out, we simply need to create more questions for the app and figure out the best way to handle data storage. For the report, we each took one section. Jiajie did part 1, Anthony did part 2, and Jason did part 3.
