Version 2

During this part of our app development, we were able to get the database fairly completed. The register screen successfully stores the user data and the login screen takes in user login. If the passwords dont match upon registering, an error box will pup up. This is also implemented for user log in. The database isn't fully functional but we're satisfied with what we have so far. For the code, we all took different parts of the database and implemented them. For the report, Jason did part 1, Anthony did part 2, and Jiajie part 3. 

Version 1 

During this part of our app development, we were able to get started on the “front page” of our app. Jiajie created the login screen, register screen, and main screen. The login screen also has a link to the register screen in case the user does not have an account. For now they are just textfields and links. The data storage capabilities have not been implemented yet. Anthony and Jason each created a question screen. The question is a textview and the answer options are buttons. From here on out, we simply need to create more questions for the app and figure out the best way to handle data storage. For the report, we each took one section. Jiajie did part 1, Anthony did part 2, and Jason did part 3.
